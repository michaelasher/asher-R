# Asher R Package

These are a few functions I've written to simplify my life. They are still in development and may have bugs. Please let me know if you catch one! 

To install this package on your computer, you can use the following commands:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("michaelasher/asherR")
```
